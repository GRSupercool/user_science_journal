          <p>Explore the topic of usability, we are going to follow Steve Krug's classic text on the subject: Don't Make Me Think Revisited. (The original is the "more classic" version. Krug highlights some of the behavioral patterns of users. Krug discusses four key concepts of  website usability , Clarity, Real User Behavior, Billboard Design, Word Omission.
            
            <p>The tools used to complete the analysis include Krugs principles of website usability, components the Usability Test posted on Usability.gov and a website for analysis, Liner World ( www.linerworld.com). The purpose of Linerworld is to sell pool liners, accesories and information to buyers on how use nd select the products on the website. 
              The analysis is based on four usability criterion in chapter one of the book.</p>

           <ol> 
            <br>1. Clarity: Don’t make me think “As far as is humanly possible, when I look at a web page it should be self-evident. Obvious. Self –Explanatory.</br> 
            <br>2. Real User Behavior: People Scan, Satifice and Muddle Through: Understanding the difference between our perception of how people use our product and the reality.</br> 
            <br>3. Billboard Design: Design for scanning not reading. As makers, were thinking “great literature”. While the Users reality is much closer to “billboard going at  60 miles an hour.” </br>
            <br>4. Omit Needless Words: Get Rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of whats left.</br> 
            </ol>
            </p>

        

          <h2 class="section-heading">Website Introduction</h2>

          <p>Swimliner.com is a commercial website selling swimming pool liners, pool accessories and supplies for above the ground pools. 
            Users can purchase products, get additional information on common pool liner questions and review how to guides on pool products.  
            </p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a
            task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of
            just beginning.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Metrics and Evaluation</h2>

          <p> Each of the four usability principles have the ability to earn 1 point. The criteria used for evaluation are as follows: 
           <p>
             <br>1.Clarity Clickability test: Is it obvious to user what’s clickable? During the purchasing process is website navigation product self-evident.</br> 
              Self Evident: meaning there’s no guesswork in completing a purchase. 
              <br>2.Real User Behavior:By simply scanning the page can users scan the page easily identify information. 
              <br>3.Billboard Design:Are the most important aspects of the webpage clear, based on effective use of visual hierarchy, page breaks,and effective copy format? 
              <br>4.Word Omission: Are there unnecessary words on the page, is the most useful information prominent, is the page clearly organized.</p>
            </p>

            <img class="img-fluid" src="img/post-sample-image.jpg" alt="">
          </a>
         
          <h3 class="section-heading">Results and Recommendations for Each Criterion of the Usability Principles</h3>
          <p>
              Each page of the transaction process was evalauated on each of the four criterion. The transaction process had a total of 7 pages and each page has the potential to score 5 total points per criteria to yield a maximum score of 30 for the entire wepage.   
              The usability website score for Liner World is 20.5/30. </p>
              
              <p>Overall, what is working for the Liner Word website? The strengths of the page are its clickability and clarity. The page provides the user with many ways to start the transaction process.
                The wesbite is designed to provide users with as many ways as possible to start the purchasing process of a product. You can click on any of the headers and objects on the page to start making a purchase.
                 The website purpose is supported by the images, colors, and link headers.If it looks like you can click on it, you can which is why clarity and clickability scored the strongest.  
                
                <p>What isnt working for the site, or what improvements can stregthen usability?
                  The website design and development feutures requireing improvement are word omission. The page has too much text making the page "loud". Many of the links lead to the same page and have similar categories that can be given a single header and turned into drop down boxes. 
                  Giving the more white space to increase its readability.  </p>  
              <p>
              Usability Results:
              
              <br>Clarity: 6/7 </br>
              <br>Real User Behavior:4.5/7 </br>
              <br>Billboard design: 5.5/7 </br>
              <br>Word Omission: 4.5/7 </br>
              </p>  
          </p>
